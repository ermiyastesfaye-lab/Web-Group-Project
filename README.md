Title - **Agricultural Management System**
Description - This system allows farmers to register, login, and manage their crops. Farmers can track the lifecycle of their crops, from planting to harvest. A farmer can be able to:
Create a new crop: Farmers can add a new crop including crop type, planting date, expected harvest date, and the planting field. The server generates a unique ID for the new crop

Read crop details: Farmers can access specific crop details using the unique crop ID. The server provides the details of the requested crop.

Update crop details: Farmers can modify crop details, such as the expected harvest date. The server returns the updated crop details.

Delete crop entry: Farmers can remove a crop entry, for instance, after the harvest and sale of the crop. The server confirms the deletion.

List all crops: Farmers can retrieve a list of all their crops. The server returns a list containing details of all crops.
