Title - **Agricultural Management System**
Description - This system allows farmers to register, login, and manage their crops. Farmers can track the lifecycle of their crops, from planting to harvest. A farmer can be able to:
Create a new crop: Farmers can add a new crop including crop type, planting date, expected harvest date, and the planting field. The server generates a unique ID for the new crop

Read crop details: Farmers can access specific crop details using the unique crop ID. The server provides the details of the requested crop.

Update crop details: Farmers can modify crop details, such as the expected harvest date. The server returns the updated crop details.

Delete crop entry: Farmers can remove a crop entry, for instance, after the harvest and sale of the crop. The server confirms the deletion.

List all crops: Farmers can retrieve a list of all their crops. The server returns a list containing details of all crops.

The reason we opted for MongoDB is due to its numerous advantages. Firstly, its schema flexibility accommodates various data types, making it ideal for handling diverse data such as crop id, crop name, crop type, planting field, harvesting date, and planting date. Secondly, its scalability ensures efficient handling of large data volumes, a crucial aspect for our growing crop management system. Thirdly, MongoDB integrates seamlessly with Nest.js, simplifying the process of defining models and reading documents. Fourthly, its developer-friendly nature accelerates the development process. Lastly, MongoDBâ€™s cloud compatibility ensures high availability, which is vital for our real-time crop management system
